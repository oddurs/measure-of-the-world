## Appendix E: Glossary

Alphabetically organized technical terms with definitions and chapter references.

Sample entries:

**Aberration (stellar)** — The apparent displacement of a star's position caused by the combination of Earth's orbital velocity with the finite speed of light. Maximum displacement ~20.5 arcseconds. See Chapter 12.

**Achromat** — A lens system (typically a doublet of crown and flint glass) designed to bring two wavelengths to a common focus, reducing chromatic aberration. See Chapter 20.

**Altitude** — The angular elevation of a celestial object above the horizon, measured along a vertical circle. Range: 0° (horizon) to 90° (zenith).

**Analemma** — The figure-eight pattern traced by the Sun's position in the sky when observed at the same mean solar time throughout the year. Encodes the equation of time and the Sun's declination variation. See Chapter 15.

**Collimation** — The alignment of optical elements in a telescope or instrument. Collimation error occurs when the optical axis does not coincide with the mechanical axis. See Chapter 13.

**Declination (δ)** — The angular distance of a celestial object north or south of the celestial equator. Analogous to latitude on Earth. Range: −90° to +90°.

**Equation of time** — The difference between apparent solar time (sundial time) and mean solar time (clock time). Ranges from about −14 to +16 minutes. See Chapter 15.

**Escapement** — The mechanism in a clock that controls the release of energy from the power source to the oscillator, providing impulses to maintain oscillation. See Chapter 21.

**Hour angle** — The angular distance of a celestial object west of the local meridian, measured along the celestial equator. Increases with time as the sky appears to rotate.

**Lunar distance** — The angular separation between the Moon and a reference celestial body (Sun or star), used historically for determining longitude at sea. See Chapter 8.

**Nutation** — A small periodic wobble in Earth's axial orientation, with principal period of 18.6 years, caused by the gravitational influence of the Moon. See Chapter 12.

**Parallax** — The apparent shift in an object's position due to a change in the observer's viewpoint. Lunar parallax: up to ~1°. Stellar parallax: <1 arcsecond for all stars.

**Personal equation** — The systematic difference in timing observations between different observers, caused by variations in reaction time. See Chapter 13.

**Precession** — The slow conical motion of Earth's rotation axis, with period ~26,000 years, caused by gravitational torques from the Sun and Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge.

**Refraction (atmospheric)** — The bending of light passing through Earth's atmosphere, causing celestial objects to appear higher than their true geometric position. See Appendix A.6.

**Right ascension (α)** — The angular distance of a celestial object eastward along the celestial equator from the vernal equinox. Measured in hours, minutes, seconds (24h = 360°).

**Sidereal time** — Time measured by the rotation of Earth relative to the stars (specifically, the vernal equinox). A sidereal day is ~4 minutes shorter than a solar day.

**Transit** — The passage of a celestial object across the observer's meridian. Transit time determines right ascension. See Chapter 4.

**Vernier** — A secondary scale that slides along a primary scale, allowing readings to fractions of the primary scale divisions.
