## Chapter 1: The Deadly Ignorance of Position

### Opening Vignette
The Scilly disaster, 22 October 1707
- Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell's fleet returning from Gibraltar
- Weather conditions: fog, heavy seas, poor visibility
- The navigational situation: fleet believes itself safely west of Ushant
- 8 PM: breakers sighted; four ships strike the Western Rocks
- HMS Association, Eagle, Romney, Firebrand lost
- Death toll: 1,400–2,000 men, including Shovell
- The aftermath: bodies washing ashore, court of inquiry

### The Problem Defined
What is longitude?
- Earth as rotating sphere; position requires two coordinates
- Latitude: angle from equator, determinable from celestial pole altitude
- Longitude: angle from arbitrary reference meridian
- The fundamental insight: longitude difference = time difference × 15°/hour
- Why this is hard: no way to know time at the reference meridian while at sea

The geometry of latitude determination
- The celestial pole altitude equals the observer's latitude
- Polaris as practical proxy (with small correction)
- Noon Sun altitude method: zenith distance plus/minus declination
- Achievable precision: within a degree with simple instruments

Why longitude resists the same approach
- No celestial feature marks longitude directly
- The sky rotates; longitude is encoded in when, not where
- To know "when" requires knowing time at two places simultaneously

### The Navigator's Dilemma
Dead reckoning: the only alternative
- Estimating speed: the chip log
- Estimating direction: the magnetic compass (with unknown variation)
- Integrating velocity over time
- Cumulative error: small errors compound over weeks at sea

Quantifying the problem
- A 1° longitude error at 50°N ≈ 40 nautical miles
- Typical dead reckoning error after Atlantic crossing: 100+ miles
- The error is invisible until landfall—or shipwreck

### A Catalog of Catastrophe
Maritime disasters attributable to longitude uncertainty
- 1591: São Thomé wrecked on Sumatra (thought to be 600 miles away)
- 1615: Dutch East Indiaman Eendracht lands in Australia unexpectedly
- 1656: Tryall strikes reef off Western Australia
- 1691: Several English ships lost near Plymouth in fog
- 1707: Scilly disaster as culmination

The human and economic cost
- Ships lost: cargoes, naval power, strategic position
- Lives lost: sailors, officers, passengers
- Insurance and risk: how uncertainty priced into trade
- National competitiveness: accurate navigation as strategic advantage

### The Political Response
Pressure building before 1714
- William Whiston and Humphry Ditton's 1714 pamphlet

- The Scilly disaster as final catalyst
- The Longitude Act as political response to accumulated frustration

- Christopher Wren: Surveyor of the King's Works
- Budget: £500 (far too little)

The Octagon Room
- Designed for long telescopes and quadrants
